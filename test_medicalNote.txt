Moderate tenderness over the lumbar region was noted during palpation. The patient exhibits a limited range of motion in the lumbar spine, with apparent stiffness.

Assessment: The patient has a fatigue fracture of the vertebra in the lumbar region with delayed healing. ICD-10 Code: M48.46xG.

Plan:

Continue pain management with ibuprofen.
Order an MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate the extent of delayed fracture healing and check for any associated disc or soft tissue abnormalities.
Refer to an orthopedic spine specialist for evaluation of potential intervention options.
Continue monitoring of symptoms and adjust treatment based on specialist feedback and imaging results.
Medical Decision Making: This is a moderately complex encounter due to the persistent, unresolved lumbar vertebral fracture requiring additional diagnostic imaging and potential specialist consultation. The decision to order an MRI to further assess the fracture healing process and any underlying complications reflects the need for comprehensive management. Consideration was given to ruling out underlying metabolic or bone health issues that could be contributing to the delayed healing process. The provided plan ensures continued evaluation and appropriate intervention for this orthopedic condition.
